B-Store-Vue is a modern, responsive e-commerce platform built with Vue.js and styled using Tailwind CSS. It allows users to browse products, view details, add items to a shopping cart, and proceed to checkout. The project demonstrates the use of Vue.js for dynamic interactions, Firebase for user authentication and database management, and Tailwind CSS for flexible, utility-first styling.
With key features like a shopping cart, product listings, and a simple checkout flow, B-Store-Vue provides a solid foundation for a small to medium-sized online store.


Key Features

- 🛒 Shopping Cart: Add products to the cart and view total prices dynamically.
- 💳 Checkout Flow: A basic checkout process for reviewing the cart and proceeding with orders (placeholder).
- 🔐 Firebase Authentication: Secure user sign-up and sign-in system with Firebase.
- 📦 Firebase Firestore: Store product and user data in Firestore for real-time updates.

How It Works
- User Authentication:
Users can sign up or log in via Firebase Authentication, ensuring secure access to their shopping cart and order history.

- Product Browsing:
The homepage showcases a list of products, each with an image, name, and price. Users can click on individual items to see more details.

- Add to Cart:
Users can click the "Add to Cart" button on each product to add it to their shopping cart. The cart icon in the navigation bar dynamically updates with the number of items added.

- Shopping Cart:
On the cart page, users can view all items they’ve added, including quantities, individual prices, and the total price.

- Checkout Process:
Users can review their cart, select shipping options, and submit their order (currently a placeholder awaiting payment system integration).

- Firebase Integration:

1. Authentication: Firebase Authentication is used for secure sign-in and sign-up.
2. 2. Firestore: Firebase Firestore is used to store product details and cart data, enabling real-time updates for users.
